## Additional Detailed Course Notes

## 1. Definition of Cloud Computing

- **Definition**: The delivery of on-demand computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence) over the Internet ("the cloud").
- **Analogy**: Similar to utility services (electricity, water) – on-demand, scalable, pay-as-you-go.
- **Core Idea**: Accessing resources remotely instead of owning and managing physical infrastructure.

### Introduction to Cloud Computing

AWS: What is Cloud Computing?

[![AWS: What is Cloud Computing?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mxT233EdY5c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxT233EdY5c)

## 2. Evolution of Computing

- **Mainframe Era (1950s-1970s)**: Centralized computing, large organizations.
- **Client-Server Model (1980s-1990s)**: Decentralized computing with PCs and local servers.
- **Cloud Era (2000s-Present)**: On-demand, globally available, scalable resources enabled by virtualization, internet speed, and storage advances.

## 3. Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users provision resources automatically without human intervention (e.g., launching an AWS VM).
2. **Broad Network Access**: Services accessible over the network via standard devices (laptops, phones, tablets) (e.g., accessing Google Drive).
3. **Resource Pooling**: Provider pools resources (computing, storage) to serve multiple customers (multi-tenant model) with dynamic allocation (e.g., AWS global data centers).
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly, automatically or manually, based on demand (e.g., e-commerce site scaling during sales).
5. **Measured Service**: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported (pay-per-use) (e.g., AWS billing based on compute hours/storage used).

## 4. Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

- **Definition**: Define how cloud services are delivered based on the level of control and management responsibility.
- **Pizza Analogy**:
  - **On-Premise**: Make pizza at home (buy everything, manage everything).
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Take and Bake (provider manages infrastructure like oven; you manage OS, toppings, cooking). _Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs._ Provides virtualized compute, storage, networks. High control, complex management.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Pizza Delivered (provider manages infrastructure, OS, runtime; you manage application/code). _Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku._ Simplifies development, limited environment control.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Dining Out (provider manages everything; you use the software). _Examples: Gmail, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365._ Easy to use, limited customization.
- **Responsibility Sharing**: Varies by model. Users manage more in IaaS, less in PaaS, and least in SaaS. (See slide 13/463/464 diagrams).
