# Run a container
docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-app

# List running containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container-id
```

### AWS CLI Essential Commands

```bash
# List S3 buckets
aws s3 ls

# Create an EC2 instance
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345678 --instance-type t2.micro

# List running EC2 instances
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running"
```

### Linux Commands for Cloud

```bash
# System information
uname -a         # System information
df -h            # Disk usage
free -m          # Memory usage
top              # Process information

## Detailed Course Notes

## 1. Introduction to Cloud Computing

- **Definition**: The delivery of on-demand computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence) over the Internet ("the cloud").
- **Analogy**: Similar to utility services (electricity, water) ‚Äì on-demand, scalable, pay-as-you-go.
- **Core Idea**: Accessing resources remotely instead of owning and managing physical infrastructure.

## 2. Evolution of Computing

- **Mainframe Era (1950s-1970s)**: Centralized computing, large organizations.
- **Client-Server Model (1980s-1990s)**: Decentralized computing with PCs and local servers.
- **Cloud Era (2000s-Present)**: On-demand, globally available, scalable resources enabled by virtualization, internet speed, and storage advances.

## 3. Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users provision resources automatically without human intervention (e.g., launching an AWS VM).
2. **Broad Network Access**: Services accessible over the network via standard devices (laptops, phones, tablets) (e.g., accessing Google Drive).
3. **Resource Pooling**: Provider pools resources (computing, storage) to serve multiple customers (multi-tenant model) with dynamic allocation (e.g., AWS global data centers).
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled up or down quickly, automatically or manually, based on demand (e.g., e-commerce site scaling during sales).
5. **Measured Service**: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported (pay-per-use) (e.g., AWS billing based on compute hours/storage used).

## 4. Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)

- **Definition**: Define how cloud services are delivered based on the level of control and management responsibility.
- **Pizza Analogy**:
  - **On-Premise**: Make pizza at home (buy everything, manage everything).
  - **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Take and Bake (provider manages infrastructure like oven; you manage OS, toppings, cooking). _Examples: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs._ Provides virtualized compute, storage, networks. High control, complex management.
  - **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Pizza Delivered (provider manages infrastructure, OS, runtime; you manage application/code). _Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Heroku._ Simplifies development, limited environment control.
  - **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Dining Out (provider manages everything; you use the software). _Examples: Gmail, Dropbox, Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365._ Easy to use, limited customization.
- **Responsibility Sharing**: Varies by model. Users manage more in IaaS, less in PaaS, and least in SaaS. (See slide 13/463/464 diagrams).

## 5. Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**: Services offered over the public internet, available to anyone (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). Shared infrastructure.
- **Private Cloud**: Cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization. Can be on-premise or hosted by a third party. More control, higher cost.
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. Offers flexibility.
- **Community Cloud**: Infrastructure shared by several organizations with common concerns (e.g., security, compliance).
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple public cloud services from different providers.

## 6. Benefits of Cloud Computing

- Cost Efficiency (Reduced CapEx, pay-as-you-go OpEx)
- Scalability and Elasticity
- High Availability and Reliability (Redundancy)
- Faster Deployment and Innovation
- Enhanced Collaboration
- Flexible Storage & Easy Data Backup/Restore
- Mobility and Remote Work Enablement
- Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery

## 7. Challenges in Cloud Computing

- **Data Security and Privacy**: Protecting sensitive data in shared environments. (Mentioned government project constraint).
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Difficulty migrating between cloud providers due to proprietary services/APIs.
- **Downtime Risks**: Service outages impacting business operations.
- **Compliance and Regulatory Issues**: Meeting industry-specific requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Performance and Latency**: Delays due to geographical distance or network limitations.
- **Cost Management**: Unpredictable costs, overspending on unused resources.

## 8. Resource Sharing in the Cloud

- **Definition**: Allocating and managing computing resources dynamically among multiple users for optimal usage.
- **Mechanism**: Often achieved through virtualization and multi-tenancy.
- **Example**: Multiple users running isolated VMs on the same physical server.
- **Key Characteristics**: On-Demand Self-Service, Broad Network Access, Resource Pooling (Multi-tenancy), Pay-as-you-go.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Allows multiple customers (tenants) to share the same infrastructure while maintaining data isolation. Key benefits include efficient resource utilization and reduced cost per user (e.g., Salesforce CRM).
- **Advantages**: Cost Savings, Scalability, High Availability, Increased Collaboration.
- **Challenges**: Data Security Risks, Performance Issues (resource contention), Compliance Issues, Vendor Lock-in.
- **Case Study**: Netflix on AWS dynamically scales resources during peak times.

## 9. AWS Core Services Deep Dive

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- **Definition**: A web service providing secure, resizable compute capacity (virtual servers) in the cloud (IaaS).
- **Goal**: Simplify web-scale cloud computing for developers.
- **Architecture**: Built on Regions and Availability Zones (AZs). AZs are isolated data centers within Regions for fault tolerance.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Elasticity**: Scale instances up/down based on workload.
  - **Customizable Configurations**: Wide selection of OS, instance types, storage.
  - **Cost Management**: Multiple pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans, Dedicated Hosts).
  - **Networking**: Secure environments via VPC.
  - **Integration**: Works with S3, RDS, Lambda, etc.
- **Instance Types**: General Purpose (t2.micro, M/T families), Compute Optimized (c5.large, C family), Memory Optimized (r5.large, R/X families), Storage Optimized (i3.large, I/D/H families), Accelerated Computing (p3.large, P/G/F/V families). Naming convention: Family-Generation-Capability.Size (e.g., `r5d.xlarge`).
- **Use Cases**: Web Hosting, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Gaming, DevOps.
- **Security**: IAM Integration, Security Groups (instance firewall), Key Pairs (SSH access), VPC (network isolation), Data Encryption (EBS, S3, TLS).
- **Storage Options**: EBS (persistent block storage), Instance Store (temporary block storage), EFS (scalable file storage), S3 Integration (object storage).
- **EC2 Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances. Components: Scaling Groups, Scaling Policies.
- **Networking**: Elastic IP Addresses (static IPs), Load Balancers (ALB, NLB), VPC Peering.

### Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
