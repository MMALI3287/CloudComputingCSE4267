## Resource Sharing in the Cloud

Resource sharing is a fundamental concept in cloud computing that enables multiple users to access and utilize the same computing resources simultaneously. This section covers technical aspects of resource sharing not covered in the main README.

### Types of Shared Resources

- **Compute resources**: CPU, GPU, memory
- **Storage resources**: Disk space, object storage
- **Network resources**: Bandwidth, IP addresses
- **Application resources**: Software, services

### Resource Allocation Strategies

- **Static allocation**: Fixed resources assigned to users
- **Dynamic allocation**: Resources allocated based on demand
- **Elastic allocation**: Resources scale up or down automatically

### Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy refers to a software architecture where a single instance of software serves multiple customers (tenants). Each tenant's data is isolated and remains invisible to other tenants.
